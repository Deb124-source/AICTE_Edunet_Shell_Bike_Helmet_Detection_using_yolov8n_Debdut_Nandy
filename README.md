# 🧠 Object Detection Project  

### Internship Project – *Edunet Foundation × Shell | AICTE Approved*

---

## 📘 Overview  

This repository contains the **Object Detection Project** developed as part of the **AICTE-approved internship program** provided by **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with **Shell**.  

The objective of this project is to design and implement an **object detection model** capable of identifying and classifying multiple objects within images or video streams using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

- To understand and apply the fundamentals of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**.  
- To build and test a **real-time object detection model** using pre-trained architectures.  
- To explore **image processing and feature extraction** techniques.  
- To analyze and visualize model performance across different datasets.  

---

## 🧩 Key Features  

- Real-time object detection using **YOLO**, **SSD**, or **Faster R-CNN** models.  
- Detection and classification of multiple objects in images or video frames.  
- Integration with **OpenCV** for camera-based live detection.  
- Visual representation of detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores.  
- Well-commented, modular code for easy understanding and modification.

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Object-Detection-Project.git
   cd Object-Detection-Project


Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the project

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Object_Detection.ipynb


or

Run the script:

python main.py


Test the model

Upload sample images or use your webcam for real-time object detection.

📊 Results

The model accurately detects and labels multiple objects in both static and dynamic environments.

Performance and accuracy depend on the dataset and model architecture used.

Results include bounding boxes, class names, and confidence levels for each detected object.
